Things to do when done with the project:
- Fix up formatting and code style (ternaries)
- Update the entire project to use Promises/Async+Await
- Organize code within main files into smaller files
- Convert handlers to class if necessary
- Split handlers into routing directory
- Streamline the naming conventions for modules
- Fix everything else that sucks with the lesson's code
- Finish converting everything to ES6 (probably already done, but check anyway)


FINALLY
- Run through the entire application one last time, fix anything I don't like.
- Test every route with every handler method thuroughly
- Write documentation on what each method expects on each path
